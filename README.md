## Key Features and Technologies

### Spring Framework
Spring is the enterprise Java platform on which BroadleafCommerce is based.  It provides numerous features, including dependency injection and transaction control.

### Security
Spring Security provides a robust security framework for controlling authentication and authorization at both the code and page level and is utilized by
for access control.

### Persistence
JPA and Hibernate represent the BroadleafCommerce ORM infrastructure for 
controlling persistence of our rich domain model.

### Search
Flexible domain search capabilities in BroadleafCommerce are provided through integration
with Solr.


### Email
Email support is provided throughout the BroadleafCommerce framework in either synchronous 
or asynchronous (JMS) modes. Email presentation customization is achieved via Thymeleaf templates.

### Modular Design
Important e-commerce touch-points can be embodied in the concept of
"Modules". A module can provide interaction with a credit card processor, or even a shipping provider. 
Any number of custom modules may be developed and utilized.


### Admin Platform
The Webb app includes a wholly extendable administrative application built with Spring MVC. The admin application also provides an easy-to-use interface
for catalog, order and customer functions and provides a robust, rule-driven environment for creating
and managing discount promotions.
